        Honors Carolina student and Computer Science major at the University of
        North Carolina (Go Heels!). Currently improving my skills in front/back
        end development and exploring my interests (going on tangents) to
        everything from machine learning to hackathons to quantum computing. As
        a Kansas native now in North Carolina, Iâ€™m excited to meet the community
        here and give back as a software developer and human being.
